# TROUBLESHOOTING DOCUMENTS #

DOCUMENT T1:
Router High CPU Troubleshooting Guide
When a router shows high CPU utilization (>80%), first identify the process consuming resources with 'show processes cpu'.
Common causes include:
1. Routing protocol misconfiguration or instability (BGP flapping, OSPF reconvergence)
2. Access Control List (ACL) processing for high traffic volumes
3. Network Address Translation (NAT) for numerous concurrent sessions
4. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or traffic anomalies
5. Logging verbosity set too high
Resolution steps:
- Check for routing protocol issues with 'show ip route summary' and 'show ip protocol'
- Review ACL configurations and consider hardware acceleration
- Monitor interface errors with 'show interface' for physical issues
- Implement Control Plane Policing (CoPP) for protection
Priority: High (Critical for core routers, Medium for edge devices)

DOCUMENT T2:
Network Latency and Packet Loss Resolution
Latency and packet loss often occur together and can severely impact application performance.
Troubleshooting approach:
1. Quantify the issue - use ping and traceroute to measure latency and loss percentage
2. Isolate the problem area - test segments of the network path separately
3. Check physical connectivity - look for interface errors, duplex mismatches
4. Review QoS configuration - ensure proper traffic prioritization
5. Monitor for microbursts - short traffic spikes that cause buffer overflows
Common root causes:
- Congestion on interfaces (check with 'show interface' for drops/discards)
- Suboptimal routing (check with 'show ip route' and 'traceroute')
- Faulty hardware or cabling (check error counters and interface status)
- MTU mismatches or fragmentation issues
Priority: High (Can significantly impact user experience)

DOCUMENT T3:
Switch Port Errors and Performance Issues
Port errors on switches often indicate physical or data link layer problems.
Error types and causes:
- CRC errors: Often caused by cabling issues, EMI, or duplex mismatches
- Collisions: Typically seen in half-duplex environments
- Input/output errors: Can indicate buffer issues or hardware problems
- Late collisions: Usually a sign of cable length violations or duplex mismatch
Troubleshooting steps:
1. Check error statistics with 'show interface' or 'show interface counters errors'
2. Verify duplex and speed settings on both ends of the connection
3. Test or replace cabling if physical issues are suspected
4. Check for port utilization and buffer exhaustion
5. Verify STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) status and configuration
Priority: Medium (Unless affecting critical services)

# OBSERVABILITY DOCUMENTS #

DOCUMENT O1:
Network Metric Baselines and Thresholds
Understanding normal behavior is essential for effective monitoring.
Key metrics and typical thresholds:
- Interface utilization: Alert at 70% sustained, Critical at 90%
- CPU utilization: Alert at 70% sustained, Critical at 90%
- Memory utilization: Alert at 80% sustained, Critical at 95%
- Packet loss: Alert at 1%, Critical at 5%
- Latency (internal network): Alert at 10ms, Critical at 50ms
- Jitter: Alert at 10ms, Critical at 30ms
Seasonal patterns:
- Business hours typically show 2-3x higher utilization than off-hours
- Month-end processing may increase database traffic by 50%
- Backup windows may saturate certain links during scheduled times
Recommended approach: Establish baselines over 2-4 weeks of normal operation before setting thresholds.

DOCUMENT O2:
Detecting Network Performance Anomalies
Anomaly detection requires correlation of multiple metrics.
Common anomalies and their signatures:
1. DDoS attacks: Sudden increase in traffic volume, connection counts, and CPU usage
2. Routing flaps: Intermittent connectivity, increased CPU, routing protocol messages
3. Broadcast storms: High broadcast/multicast packet counts, increased latency
4. Link flapping: Interface status changes, routing reconvergence, packet loss
5. Memory leaks: Gradually increasing memory usage without corresponding traffic increase
Detection methods:
- Rate of change is often more important than absolute values
- Correlate metrics across multiple devices to identify systemic issues
- Look for divergence from historical patterns at similar time periods
- Set dynamic thresholds based on standard deviations from baseline

DOCUMENT O3:
Network Capacity Planning and Trending
Proactive capacity management prevents performance issues.
Key metrics to trend:
- Interface throughput (95th percentile usage over time)
- Growth rate of connected devices and users
- Connection rates and session counts
- Application-specific metrics (response times, transaction rates)
Warning signs requiring attention:
- Consistent growth of >5% per month on critical links
- Latency increases during peak periods
- Reduction in available headroom below 30%
- Step changes in utilization patterns
Planning guidelines:
- Plan capacity upgrades when projected to reach 70% within 6 months
- Consider redundancy and failover capacity in calculations
- Account for seasonal variations and special events

DOCUMENT D1:
Network Topology Fundamentals
Understanding dependencies between network devices is crucial for impact analysis.
Network layers and dependencies:
1. Core layer: High-speed backbone, minimal configuration, maximum reliability
2. Distribution layer: Routing, filtering, QoS, and policy enforcement
3. Access layer: End-user connectivity, security features, and service delivery
Critical paths:
- Default gateway dependency: End users depend on their default gateway
- Uplink dependency: Access switches depend on distribution switches
- Routing peer dependency: Routers depend on their routing neighbors
Redundancy considerations:
- Single points of failure should be identified and mitigated
- Redundant paths should not share physical infrastructure
- Control plane redundancy is as important as data plane redundancy

DOCUMENT D2:
Network Device Roles and Classification
Properly classifying device roles helps with troubleshooting and change management.
Common device roles:
- Core router: Central backbone connectivity and routing
- Edge router: Internet or WAN connectivity
- Distribution switch: Aggregation and policy enforcement
- Access switch: End-user and device connectivity
- Firewall: Security policy enforcement and segmentation
- Load balancer: Application traffic distribution and health monitoring
- WAN optimizer: Traffic compression and protocol optimization
Criticality classification:
- Tier 1: Failure affects entire network or critical business services
- Tier 2: Failure affects multiple departments or non-critical services
- Tier 3: Failure affects limited number of users or services
Change management implications:
- Tier 1 devices require more rigorous testing and maintenance windows
- Dependencies should be documented and considered during changes
- Backup configurations must be verified before significant changes

DOCUMENT D3:
High-Availability Network Design Patterns
Resilient networks require both redundancy and proper failover mechanisms.
Key high-availability patterns:
1. Active/Standby: Primary device with backup that takes over on failure
2. Active/Active: Load shared across multiple devices with failover capability
3. N+1 redundancy: Additional capacity beyond what's required for normal operation
4. Distributed systems: Services spread across multiple devices with no single point of failure
Implementation technologies:
- Routing redundancy: HSRP, VRRP, GLBP for default gateway redundancy
- Link redundancy: Equal-cost multi-path, port channels, spanning tree
- Control plane redundancy: NSF (Non-Stop Forwarding), SSO (Stateful Switchover)
- Device redundancy: Clustered systems, chassis redundancy, geographic distribution
Recovery metrics:
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Maximum acceptable time to restore service
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): Maximum acceptable data loss during recovery
- MTTR (Mean Time To Repair): Average time to restore service after failure
